# Bookmark Sync
(in progress)

## Description
Goal of this project is to consolidate all browser bookmarks from different context of usage like work context, home context, mobile context  into one global Json file. The purpose is to share the bookmarks between different contexts, but each context can keep its own individual sets of bookmarks defined in a whitelist. Furthermore, it enforces to categorize bookmarks properly and
This project here focuses only on browser bookmarks. Alternative solutions are Pocket, Xmark, Weave, etc., with the difference that these are cloud based and aim to share bookmarks between different devices (under one account) rather than sharing bookmarks under different contexts.

* supported browsers: chrome and firefox

Further planned:
* check script for stale links
* import/export to/from browser automatically (not sure if this works)
